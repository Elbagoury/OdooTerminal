# Roadmap

```
- Solve some boostrap "glitches" printing error section in 11.0 (Because Terminal uses BS4 and 11.0 BS3)
- Remove extension storage data after uninstall (chrome doesn't have any 'event' to handle this)
- Use some kind of mock to cover all commands in tests (See Untested Commands section in docs/testing.md)
```
